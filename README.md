#<center>MineSweeper 3D</center>
This is a 3D looking MineSweeper game created using Ogre engine, CEGUI, Bullet physics engine, and C++. I developed this game as a part of the final project for [Game Engine Development class](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~cpresser/cs391/finalProject.html) that I took during the Spring Semester of 2015 at Gettysburg  College.  You can find more information about the game as well as instruction on how to build it here:
